# How to run Alphabetizer

First, ensure that Java is installed on your system. You can check this by opening a terminal and typing:

```bash
java -version
```

If Java is not installed, you can install it using your package manager. For example, on Ubuntu, you can install the Java Development Kit (JDK) with:

```bash

sudo apt update
sudo apt install default-jdk
```

Compile your Java program using the **`javac`** command.

```bash
javac Alphabetizer.java

```

Run the compiled Java program using the **`java`** command. Specify the name of the class that contains your **`main`** method without the **`.class`** extension:

```bash

java Alphabetizer VirginiaTech "3 Blind Mice" "aAbaABA"

```
